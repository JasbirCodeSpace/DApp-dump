In the modified smart contract, I added two additional features: Quest review functionality and Edit/Delete quests.

### 1. Quest Review Functionality:

* The admin can review player submissions for a quest and approve or reject them.
* The admin can provide a reward amount (up to the maximum number of rewards specified for the quest) when approving a submission.
* The status of a player's quest submission can be changed to either "APPROVED" or "REJECTED."
* This feature allows the admin to actively participate in the quest completion process and incentivize players accordingly.

### 2. Edit and Delete Quests:

* The admin can edit the details of existing quests such as title, reward, number of rewards, start time, and end time.
* The admin can also delete quests if necessary.
* This feature provides flexibility to update or remove quests based on changing requirements or conditions.

### Benefits
The added features enhance the functionality of the StackUp contract by providing greater control and customization options to the admin. Quest review functionality enables the admin to validate and reward player submissions, ensuring fair participation and distribution of rewards. The ability to edit and delete quests empowers the admin to manage and maintain the quest list effectively, adapting to evolving campaign requirements or addressing any issues that may arise.
